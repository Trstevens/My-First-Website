    <h1>About This Website</h1>
<section>
    <p class="about-main">This is a website dedicated to the love I have for computer programming. I really enjoyed making this website. This is the result of self-learning and dedication. I wanted to base it off my favorite team to really challenge myself into making this website pleasing aesthetically with good content. This is the first step in my long journey to becoming a full stack developer. Front-end development has challenged me in many ways. Specifically I had issues with positioning and parent/child elements. I hope to vastly improve on this as I continue to learn. Next up is javascript. I hope to learn even more interesting ways of web devlopement. As I am self-taught I hope to have a full understanding of front-end development by November 2019. This is my goal.</p>
